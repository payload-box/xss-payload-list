# XSS 101: Understanding Cross-Site Scripting

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

## 1. Reflected XSS

**What is it?**
The malicious script is reflected off the web server, such as in an error message or search result.
**Mechanism:**

1. Attacker constructs a URL containing the malicious script.
2. Victim clicks the URL.
3. The script executes in the victim's browser.
**Example:**
`http://example.com/search?q=<script>alert(1)</script>`

## 2. Stored XSS (Persistent)

**What is it?**
The malicious script is permanently stored on the target server (e.g., in a database, forum post, comment field).
**Mechanism:**

1. Attacker posts a comment containing the malicious script.
2. The comment is saved to the database.
3. Every time a user views the comment, the script executes.
**Example:**
Comment: `Great post! <script>stealCookies()</script>`

## 3. DOM-based XSS

**What is it?**
The vulnerability exists in the client-side code (JavaScript) rather than the server-side code.
**Mechanism:**

1. The application takes data from a source (e.g., URL fragment) and executes it in a sink (e.g., `eval()`).
**Example:**
Page code: `eval(location.hash.slice(1))`
Attacker URL: `http://example.com#alert(1)`

## Impact of XSS

- **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies.
- **Phishing:** Displaying fake login forms.
- **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious sites.
- **Keylogging:** Capturing keystrokes.
